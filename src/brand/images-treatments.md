# Image Treatments
Color treatments allow the use of text over images and to be used stylistically.

## Color Overlays



## Light Leaks
Light leaks are created when light seeps in through the cracks in a camera body or lens. Use this technique to refresh existing photographs (top right) and give them a bright, warm feeling. Directions for use in Photoshop are in a text file included in the download.

**"Too much of a good thing is not a good thing."**

When used wisely, the light leaks can add a sense of professionalism to an otherwise plain or simple photo, or pictures taken from a mobile device.
