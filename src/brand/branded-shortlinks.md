# URL Shortener & Shortlinks

Some pages have a very long URL and are not great for sharing on social media or print.

Instead of bit.ly, we have a custom shortlink domain:

<span style="font-size:2rem;font-weight:bold;">https://<wbr>rmad.ac/</span>

We use the servise **Rebrandly** to create and track these links

## Rebrandly

To log in, visit https://rebrandly.com

On the FREE plan, we are limited to 10 links per month.

### Link Tracking

This is great to see how often our links get tracked. We can use this information to measure the success of our campaigns, be it email, print, or social media.

### Branded URL

Shortlinks look much better coming from `rmad.ac` than from `bit.ly`.

### Link Management

This is perfect for print materials or other campaigns. If ever we decide to change a page, we can update the destination in Rebrandly to continue to track how often that link is clicked.

### Campaign URLs

Google Analytics uses UTM parameters to track more details about links. You may haves seen a link like the following:

`example.com/page?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=june-2024-newsletter`

This helps us also track useful click information in Google Analytics as well.
