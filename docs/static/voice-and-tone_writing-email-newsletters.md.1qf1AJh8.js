As devices shrink and the inbox evolves, our oldest tip is still the most important: Only send when you have something to say.</p><h2 id="guidelines" tabindex="-1">Guidelines <a class="header-anchor" href="#guidelines" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Guidelines&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Email newsletters generally follow the style points outlined in the <strong>Voice and tone</strong> and <strong>Grammar and mechanics</strong> sections. Here are some additional considerations.</p><h2 id="consider-all-elements" tabindex="-1">Consider all elements <a class="header-anchor" href="#consider-all-elements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Consider all elements&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Every email newsletter is made up of the following elements. Make sure they’re all in place before clicking send:</p><h3 id="from-name" tabindex="-1">&quot;From&quot; name <a class="header-anchor" href="#from-name" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&quot;From&quot; name&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This is usually your name or the team’s name. It identifies the sender in the recipient&#39;s inbox.</p><h3 id="subject-line" tabindex="-1">Subject line <a class="header-anchor" href="#subject-line" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Subject line&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Keep your subject line descriptive. There&#39;s no perfect length, but some email clients display only the first words. Tell—don&#39;t sell—what&#39;s inside. Subject lines should be in sentence case. (Note that this is different from a headline, which you may want to include in the campaign itself.)</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Don&#39;t do this:</strong> Hoping to schedule a meeting later this week.</li><li><strong>Do this:</strong> Can you meet?</li></ul><h2 id="writing-the-email-newsletter" tabindex="-1">Writing the email/newsletter <a class="header-anchor" href="#writing-the-email-newsletter" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Writing the email/newsletter&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="body-copy" tabindex="-1">Body copy <a class="header-anchor" href="#body-copy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Body copy&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Keep your content concise. Write with a clear purpose, and connect each paragraph to your main idea. Add images when they’re helpful.</p><h3 id="call-to-action" tabindex="-1">Call to action <a class="header-anchor" href="#call-to-action" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Call to action&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Make the next step clear. Whether you’re asking people to buy something, read something, share something, or respond to something, offer a clear direction to close your message so readers know what to do next.</p><h3 id="consider-your-perspective" tabindex="-1">Consider your perspective <a class="header-anchor" href="#consider-your-perspective" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Consider your perspective&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When sending an email newsletter from RMADA, use the 3rd person “we.” When sending a message as an individual, use the 1st person.</p><h3 id="use-a-hierarchy" tabindex="-1">Use a hierarchy <a class="header-anchor" href="#use-a-hierarchy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Use a hierarchy&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Most readers will be scanning your emails or viewing them on a small screen. Put the most important information first.</p><h3 id="avoid-unnecessary-links" tabindex="-1">Avoid unnecessary links <a class="header-anchor" href="#avoid-unnecessary-links" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Avoid unnecessary links&quot;">​</a></h3><p>More than 50 percent of emails are read on a mobile device. Limit links to the most important resources to focus your call to action and prevent errant taps on smaller screens.</p><h3 id="use-alt-text" tabindex="-1">Use alt text <a class="header-anchor" href="#use-alt-text" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Use alt text&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Some email clients disable images by default. Include an alt tag to describe the information in the image for people who aren’t able to see it.</p><h3 id="segment-your-audience" tabindex="-1">Segment your audience <a class="header-anchor" href="#segment-your-audience" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Segment your audience&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It’s exciting to send to millions of users at once, but it’s doubtful that every subscriber is interested in every topic. Segment your list to find a particular audience that’s likely to react.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve selected an audience, adjust the language to fit their needs. For example, users who developed custom integrations are more likely to understand and appreciate direct, technical terms.</p><h3 id="test-your-campaigns" tabindex="-1">Test your campaigns <a class="header-anchor" href="#test-your-campaigns" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Test your campaigns&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Use the preview mode to begin, and run an Inbox Inspection to see your newsletter in different email clients. Read your campaign out loud to yourself, then send a test to a coworker for a second look.</p>',30),r=[o];function s(l,d,c,h,u,m){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const y=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,y as default};
