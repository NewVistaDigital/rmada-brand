Whether you’re writing for an internal or external audience, it&#39;s important to write for and about other people in a way that’s compassionate, inclusive, and respectful. Being aware of the impact of your language will help make RMADA a better place to work and a better steward of our values in our community. In this section we&#39;ll lay out some guidelines for writing about people with compassion, and share some resources for further learning.</p><h2 id="as-part-of-an-audience" tabindex="-1">As part of an audience <a class="header-anchor" href="#as-part-of-an-audience" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;As part of an audience&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Don’t capitalize “audience” unless it’s grammatically necessary.</li><li>Don’t refer to an audience as “it.” Audiences are made up of real people, so always use “they.”</li></ul><h2 id="age" tabindex="-1">Age <a class="header-anchor" href="#age" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Age&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Don’t reference a person’s age unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If it <em>is</em> relevant, include the person’s specific age, offset by commas.</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><ul><li>The CEO, 16, just got her driver’s license.</li></ul><p>Don’t refer to people using age-related descriptors like “young,” “old,” or “elderly” unless it&#39;s necessary.</p><h2 id="disability" tabindex="-1">Disability <a class="header-anchor" href="#disability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Disability&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Avoid disability-related idioms like “lame” or “falling on deaf ears.” Don’t refer to a person’s disability unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If you need to mention it, ask whether your subject prefers person-first language (“they have a disability”) or identity-first language (“they are disabled”).</p><p>When writing about a person with disabilities, don’t use the words “suffer,” “victim,” or “handicapped.”</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Wrong</strong> Handicapped parking is available.</li><li><strong>Right:</strong> Accessible parking is available.</li></ul><h2 id="gender-and-sexuality" tabindex="-1">Gender and sexuality <a class="header-anchor" href="#gender-and-sexuality" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Gender and sexuality&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Don’t call groups of people “guys.” Don’t call women “girls.”</p><p>Avoid gendered terms, unless it&#39;s relevant, in favor of neutral alternatives, like “server” instead of “waitress” and “businessperson” instead of “businessman.”</p><p><strong>Example</strong> Use the following words as modifiers, but <em>never</em> as nouns:</p><ul><li>lesbian</li><li>gay</li><li>bisexual</li><li>transgender (never &quot;transgendered&quot;)</li><li>trans</li><li>queer</li><li>LGBT</li></ul><p><strong>Example</strong> Don’t use these words in reference to LGBT people or communities:</p><ul><li>homosexual</li><li>lifestyle</li><li>preference</li></ul><p>Don’t use “same-sex” marriage, unless the distinction is relevant to what you’re writing. (Avoid “gay marriage.”) Otherwise, it’s just “marriage.”</p><p>When writing about a person, use their communicated pronouns. When in doubt, just ask or use their name.</p><h2 id="hearing" tabindex="-1">Hearing <a class="header-anchor" href="#hearing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hearing&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Use “deaf” as an adjective to describe a person with significant hearing loss.

For example, use &quot;Asian American&quot; instead of &quot;Asian-American.&quot;</p><p>Use the term “undocumented immigrants” over “illegal immigrants”.

Don’t call a person with a medical condition a “victim.”</p><h2 id="mental-and-cognitive-conditions" tabindex="-1">Mental and cognitive conditions <a class="header-anchor" href="#mental-and-cognitive-conditions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Mental and cognitive conditions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Don’t refer to a person’s mental or cognitive condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. Never assume that someone has a medical, mental, or cognitive condition.</p><p>Don’t describe a person as “mentally ill.” If a reference to a person’s mental or cognitive condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities or medical conditions and emphasize the person first.</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><ul><li>A mentally ill child is welcome in services.</li><li>Children with developmental disabilities are welcome.</li></ul><h2 id="vision" tabindex="-1">Vision <a class="header-anchor" href="#vision" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Vision&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Use the adjective “blind” to describe a person who is unable to see.
