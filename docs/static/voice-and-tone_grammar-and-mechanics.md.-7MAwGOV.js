Then use the short version for all other references. If the abbreviation isn’t clearly related to the full version, specify in parentheses.</p><ul><li>First use: Americans with Disabilities Act</li><li>Second use: ADA</li><li>First use: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</li><li>Second use: UTC</li></ul><p>If the abbreviation or acronym is well known, like HTML or ASAP, use it instead (and don’t worry about spelling it out).</p><h3 id="active-voice" tabindex="-1">Active voice <a class="header-anchor" href="#active-voice" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Active voice&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.</p><p>In active voice, the subject of the sentence does the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action done to it.</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Don&#39;t:</strong> The form was filled out by James.</li><li><strong>Do:</strong> James filled out the form.</li></ul><p>Words like “was” and “by” may indicate that you’re writing in passive voice.

Otherwise, use the numeral.

If it&#39;s an expression that typically uses spelled-out numbers, leave them that way.</p><ul><li>A friendly welcome email can help you make a great first impression.</li><li>That is a third-party integration.</li><li>After drop someone off, give them a high-five.</li></ul><p>Numbers over 3 digits get commas:</p><ul><li>999</li><li>1,000</li><li>150,000</li></ul><p>Write out big numbers in full. Abbreviate them if there are space restraints, as in a tweet or a chart: 1k, 150k.</p><h3 id="dates" tabindex="-1">Dates <a class="header-anchor" href="#dates" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Dates&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Generally, spell out the day of the week and the month. Abbreviate only if space is an issue in the app.</p><ul><li>Saturday, January 24</li><li>Sat., Jan. 24</li></ul><h3 id="decimals-and-fractions" tabindex="-1">Decimals and fractions <a class="header-anchor" href="#decimals-and-fractions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Decimals and fractions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Spell out fractions.</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Don&#39;t:</strong> 2/3</li><li><strong>Do:</strong> Two-thirds</li></ul><p>Use decimal points when a number can’t be easily written out as a fraction, like 1.375 or 47.2.

If the word already ends in an s and it’s singular, you also add an ‘s. If the word ends in an s and is plural, just add an apostrophe.</p><ul><li>The donut thief ate Sam’s donut.</li><li>The donut thief ate Chris’s donut.</li><li>The donut thief ate the managers’ donuts.</li></ul><p>Apostrophes can also be used to denote that you’ve dropped some letters from a word, usually for humor or emphasis. This is fine, but do it sparingly.</p><h3 id="colons" tabindex="-1">Colons <a class="header-anchor" href="#colons" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Colons&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Use a colon (rather than an ellipsis, em dash, or comma) to offset a list.</p><ul><li>Erin ordered 3 kinds of donuts: glazed, chocolate, and pumpkin.</li></ul><p>You can also use a colon to join 2 related phrases. If a complete sentence follows the colon, capitalize the 1st word.</p><ul><li>I was faced with a dilemma: I wanted a donut, but I’d just eaten a bagel.</li></ul><h3 id="commas" tabindex="-1">Commas <a class="header-anchor" href="#commas" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Commas&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When writing a list, use the serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma). This is a comma before the &quot;and.&quot;</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Don&#39;t:</strong> David admires his parents, Oprah and Justin Timberlake.</li><li><strong>Do:</strong> David admires his parents, Oprah, and Justin Timberlake.</li></ul><p>Otherwise, use common sense. If you’re unsure, read the sentence out loud. Where you find yourself taking a breath, use a comma.</p><h3 id="dashes-and-hyphens" tabindex="-1">Dashes and hyphens <a class="header-anchor" href="#dashes-and-hyphens" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Dashes and hyphens&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Use a hyphen (-) without spaces on either side to link words into single phrase, or to indicate a span or range.</p><ul><li>first-time applicant</li><li>Monday-Friday</li></ul><p>Use an em dash (—) without spaces on either side to offset an aside.</p><p>Use a true em dash, not hyphens (- or --).</p><ul><li>Multivariate testing—just one of our new Pro features—can help you grow your business.</li><li>Austin thought Brad was the donut thief, but he was wrong—it was Lain.</li></ul><h3 id="ellipses" tabindex="-1">Ellipses <a class="header-anchor" href="#ellipses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ellipses&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Ellipses (...) can be used to indicate that you’re trailing off before the end of a thought. Use them sparingly. Don’t use them for emphasis or drama, and don’t use them in titles or headers.</p><ul><li>“Where did all those donuts go?” Christy asked. Lain said, “I don&#39;t know...”</li></ul><p>Ellipses, in brackets, can also be used to show that you&#39;re omitting words in a quote.</p><ul><li>“When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, [...] a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.”</li></ul><h3 id="periods" tabindex="-1">Periods <a class="header-anchor" href="#periods" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Periods&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Leave one space between sentences, never 2.</p><p>Periods go inside quotation marks. They go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.</p><ul><li>Christy said, “I ate a donut.”</li><li>I ate a donut (and I ate a bagel, too).</li><li>I ate a donut and a bagel. (The donut was Sam’s.)</li></ul><h3 id="question-marks" tabindex="-1">Question marks <a class="header-anchor" href="#question-marks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Question marks&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Question marks go inside quotation marks if they’re part of the quote. Like periods, they go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.</p><h3 id="exclamation-points" tabindex="-1">Exclamation points <a class="header-anchor" href="#exclamation-points" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Exclamation points&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Use exclamation points sparingly, and never more than one at a time. They’re like high-fives: A well-timed one is great, but too many can be annoying.</p><p>Exclamation points go inside quotation marks. Like periods and question marks, they go outside parentheses when the parenthetical is part of a larger sentence, and inside parentheses when the parenthetical stands alone.</p><p>Never use exclamation points in failure messages or alerts. When in doubt, avoid!</p><h3 id="quotation-marks" tabindex="-1">Quotation marks <a class="header-anchor" href="#quotation-marks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quotation marks&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Use quotes to refer to words and letters, titles of short works (like articles and poems), and direct quotations.</p><p>Periods and commas go within quotation marks. Question marks within quotes follow logic—if the question mark is part of the quotation, it goes within. If you’re asking a question that ends with a quote, it goes outside the quote.</p><p>Use single quotation marks for quotes within quotes.</p><ul><li>Who was it that said, “A fool and his donut are easily parted”?</li><li>Brad said, “A wise man once told me, ‘A fool and his donut are easily parted.’”</li></ul><p>Never use quotation marks as emphasis. This comes across as sarcastic. Instead, sparingly use italics.</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Don&#39;t:</strong> Our services are for &quot;everyone.&quot;</li><li><strong>Do:</strong> Our services are for <em>everyone</em>.</li></ul><h3 id="semicolons" tabindex="-1">Semicolons <a class="header-anchor" href="#semicolons" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Semicolons&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Go easy on semicolons. They usually support long, complicated sentences that could easily be simplified. Try an em dash (—) instead, or simply start a new sentence.</p><h3 id="ampersands" tabindex="-1">Ampersands <a class="header-anchor" href="#ampersands" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ampersands&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Don&#39;t use ampersands unless one is part of a company or brand name.</p><ul><li>Ben and Dan</li><li>Ben &amp; Jerry’s</li></ul><h2 id="people-places-and-things" tabindex="-1">People, places, and things <a class="header-anchor" href="#people-places-and-things" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;People, places, and things&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="file-extensions" tabindex="-1">File extensions <a class="header-anchor" href="#file-extensions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;File extensions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When referring generally to a file extension type, use all uppercase without a period. Add a lowercase s to make plural.</p><ul><li>GIF</li><li>PDF</li><li>HTML</li><li>JPGs</li></ul><p>When referring to a specific file, the filename should be lowercase:</p><ul><li>slowclap.gif</li><li>MCBenefits.pdf</li><li>ben-twitter-profile.jpg</li><li>ilovedonuts.html</li></ul><h3 id="pronouns" tabindex="-1">Pronouns <a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pronouns&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If your subject’s gender is unknown or irrelevant, use “they,” “them,” and “their” as a singular pronoun.

On all other mentions, refer to them by their first name.</p><p>Capitalize the names of departments and teams (but not the word &quot;team&quot; or &quot;department&quot;).</p><ul><li>Transportation team</li><li>Support department</li></ul><p>Capitalize individual job titles when referencing to a specific role. Don&#39;t capitalize when referring to the role in general terms.</p><ul><li>Our new Marketing Manager starts today.</li><li>All the managers ate donuts.</li></ul><p>Don&#39;t refer to someone as a “guru,” “rockstar,” or “wizard” unless they literally are one.</p><h3 id="schools" tabindex="-1">Schools <a class="header-anchor" href="#schools" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Schools&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The first time you mention a school, college, or university in a piece of writing, refer to it by its full official name.
